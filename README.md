# üí¨ Social Media Website üí¨
In this project, I worked on my **Full-Stack Developer** skills and created a website called "Topics". 

Topics is a social media website where people can #tag their posts and gather around tagged topics. Users can interact with posts, follow other accounts, and search for topics.

## üé® Concepts:
**Infinite Scrolling | N-Layered Structure (N-Tier) | Generic Repository Design Pattern | OOP | SOLID | Entity Framework CodeFirst | IOC Container**

## üíª Demo:
### ‚óº Welcome Page
A Bootstrap carousel welcomes the user on this page. The user can either log in or register. The login and register inputs are checked with jQuery validation.

### ‚óº Home Feed
The home feed consists of 3 tabs.
- The Following tab shows posts from accounts the user follows.
- The Latest tab shows all posts created, sorted by creation date.
- The Popular tab shows posts with the most interaction (likes, reposts, comments).

**Infinite Scrolling** design pattern is used here, the page loads posts as the user scrolls down.

### ‚óº Profile
The user profile displays the posts, likes, and reposts made by that account, as well as the number of posts, followers, and people followed. Depending on the account, one of the "edit profile", "follow" or "unfollow" buttons will appear below the profile picture.

### ‚óº Tag and Account Search
The user can click on the tags or write the tag name on the search bar to find posts with that tag name. The user can also find accounts through the search bar.

### ‚óº Creating Posts
The user can create posts via the "Create" button on the navigation bar, or the "Create Post" button on the right side column of the home feed (displayed only on large screens). If it is the first time posting, another create button is displayed on the user profile.

To add tags to posts, click the add tag button, start typing your tag, and press enter. If you decide you no longer want that tag, select it and then click the trash can that appears.
